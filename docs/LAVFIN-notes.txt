- alum blocks threaded 1 edge only, goes down
- orient motors with wires inward?
- check bridge orientation?
- M3*6 for LM298 bridge too short; swap all 4 with M3*8 cell box
- put middle line-follower nuts on first
- orientation of colored (thinner) plate matters
- fasten top to bottom < connecting motor wires?
- BT !install?
- IR sensor (lesson 7): follow wiring pictures, not text! (+5 + signal swapped)
- line tracking (lesson 8): example only uses 1 sensor; how to use 3?
- BT (lesson 9): LAFVIN app !found in Play Store, but other app worked; why unplug each time?
- Motor driver (Lesson 10): hook this up < attaching upper deck?
- loosen H bridge terminal  screws < assembly, remove jumpers, no LED on bridge board?
